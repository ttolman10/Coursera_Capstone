    "<p>A potential client desires to know the best location to set up a Mexican restaurant in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The client had operated a very successful Mexican restaurant for over ten years in Miami, Florida, USA. Operating in the food business has been in his family for several generations. The client relocated to Utah because many members of his family have relocated to Salt Lake City. However, he is very unfamiliar with the demographics and competition for mexican food in the greater Salt Lake City area.</p>\n",

The client already knows that Mexican food is the third most popular type of cuisine in Utah, which is 50% higher than the national avereage<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a></sup>. This will be a family venue, so the potential location preferrably needs to be closer to an urban area.</p>"
